  desc: Hello, my name is Kynan. I am a first year Master's student at the University of Alberta studying Humanities Computing. During my undergraduate degree in Computer Science Specialization I discovered that there were a wide range of different application Computing Science could have on other fields. From the health sector to education, the possibilities were endless. With that in mind I decided to pursue these applications in a Masterâ€™s Program at the University of Alberta.
